************************************** Instructions to run the code *****************************************

In order to run code in chapter5 or chapter5_random (objective based approach), we need to supply two values to maze_experiment.py. These are the medium or hard environment and number of generations. Hence, you can run this code using the following command:
$ python maze_experiment.py -m hard -g 400

In order to run code in chapter6 or chapter6_random (Novelty search optimization), we need to supply three values to maze_experiment.py. These are the medium or hard environment, number of generations and number of trials. Hence, you can run this code using the following command:
$ python maze_experiment.py -m hard -g 400 -t 1
