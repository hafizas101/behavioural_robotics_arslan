The balancing bot is a robot with two wheels on the same axis that should manage to keep its body
balanced, i.e. upright. The robot has three sensors that encode the orientation and angular velocity of
its body and the angular velocity of its wheels. Moreover, it has an actuator that controls the angular
velocity of the wheels. The balancing bot is made of a rectangular body with two cylindrical wheels
on each side.
